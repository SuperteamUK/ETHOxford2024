# ETH Oxford 2024
_Superteam UK, a community of builders on Solana, will support all projects & builders during and after the hackathon._

Your challenge for the ETH Oxford Hackathon is to build a blockchain solution within one of our selected emerging tech industries, then after this in-person hackathon youâ€™ll have the opportunity to continue development on Solana with support from our UK team for submitting into the [Renaissance Hackathon](https://www.colosseum.org/renaissance).

If youâ€™re not already aware; Solana is a high-performance, open-source blockchain platform. Solana offers many innovations like no mem-pool, parallel transaction processing, compressed NFTs, etc. You can read more about Solana [here](https://github.com/helius-labs/solana-awesome?tab=readme-ov-file).

Selected Industries:
- DePin
- Gaming
- Consumer Apps
- Defi & Payments
- Infrastructure
- DAOs & Communities

Focus on the innovative part of the complete solution during the course of this hackathon, and then post-hackathon work with SuperteamUK to continue building into the Solana Renaissance Hackathon by [Colosseum](http://colosseum.org). 

Winners of the Renaissance hackathon will also be accepted into Colosseumâ€™s accelerator program, and have the opportunity to secure $250k in pre-seed funding for their project.

**Judging criteria**

- Impact: Does the proposed problem make sense or be helpful to anyone? How large is the effect on the Solana ecosystem?
- Solution: How clever is the solution? The rule of thumb is the less code a solution requires, the better it is.
- Completeness: How far is the code base from production?
- Applications: How does your AI solution apply to blockchain, and utilise the innovative features of Solana

Prizes

- 1 xðŸ¥‡ USDC 2,000

All winners will be invited to become SuperteamUK members for access to [exclusive perks](https://superteam.fun/member-perks), and receive a ticket to [Zebu Live](https://www.zebulive.xyz/) in London 10-11th October 2024.
